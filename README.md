# CloseEnough Movie Bot üé¨
## Basic Details
### Team Name: Sidharth Menon V
### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sidharth Menon V - Saintgits College of Engineering

### Project Description
A Telegram bot that gives you Malayalam movie recommendations that are "close enough" to what you asked for - featuring deliberately wrong suggestions, random typos, and vintage movie bias to maximize user confusion and entertainment.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People get exactly the movie recommendations they ask for, leading to predictable viewing experiences and boring conversations. Users suffer from the curse of accurate suggestions and helpful movie databases.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our bot uses advanced "fuzzy logic" to provide movie recommendations that are technically related but hilariously wrong! Want Mohanlal movies? Get movies NAMED Mohanlal (but he's not in them)! Ask for action? Receive comedies with "Action" in the title! We've solved accuracy with creative inaccuracy!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python 3.8+
- python-telegram-bot (Telegram Bot API wrapper)
- fuzzywuzzy (String matching library)
- python-levenshtein (String distance calculations)
- JSON (Local movie database)
- Regular expressions (Keyword extraction)

For Hardware:
- Server/Local machine to run the bot
- Internet connection
- Telegram account

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd malayalam-movie-bot

# Install dependencies
pip install python-telegram-bot fuzzywuzzy python-levenshtein

# Create a Telegram bot via @BotFather and get your token
# Set environment variable
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
```

# Run
```bash
# Start the bot
python bot.py

# The bot will create malayalam_movies.json automatically on first run
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the bot
```
