# 🎬 Malayalam Movie Troll Bot - CloseEnough_movie

> *A delightfully useless Telegram bot that gives you movie recommendations... just not the ones you asked for!* 

## 🏆 Made for Useless Project 2.0 Hackathon by TinkerHub

**The Problem**: You ask for good movie recommendations, and you get exactly what you asked for.
**Our Solution**: You ask for good movie recommendations, and we give you... *interesting* alternatives! 😉

## 🤔 What Makes This Bot Useless?

- **Ask for "Mohanlal movies"** → Get movies named after Mohanlal (but he's not in them!)
- **Want "action films"** → Receive comedies with "Action" in the title
- **Search "horror movies"** → Get psychological thrillers from the 1990s
- **Type perfectly** → We'll add random typos to movie titles anyway
- **Expect accuracy** → We'll swap movie details between recommendations
- **Trust our ratings** → We'll "allegedly" adjust them randomly

## 🎭 Features That Make You Question Everything

### Core Trolling Mechanisms
- **Fuzzy Matching Gone Wrong**: Uses advanced algorithms to find the *worst* possible matches
- **Deliberate Inaccuracies**: 20% chance of typos, 10% chance of wrong ratings, guaranteed confusion
- **Vintage Bias**: Prioritizes movies from the stone age (1990s) over modern films
- **Genre Confusion**: "Action" movies that are actually comedies, "Horror" films that are family dramas
- **Random Plot Additions**: Every movie has a surprise dance-off in the climax!

### Interactive Features
- 🎲 Random movie generator (for when you want to be surprised)
- 📊 Stats tracking (to see how many times we've trolled you)
- 🔍 External movie search (when our database fails you, which it will)
- ⌨️ Interactive keyboards (because buttons are fun)
