# üé¨ Malayalam Movie Troll Bot - CloseEnough_movie

> *A delightfully useless Telegram bot that gives you movie recommendations... just not the ones you asked for!* 

## üèÜ Made for Useless Project 2.0 Hackathon by TinkerHub

**The Problem**: You ask for good movie recommendations, and you get exactly what you asked for.
**Our Solution**: You ask for good movie recommendations, and we give you... *interesting* alternatives! :)

## What Makes This Bot Useless?

- **Ask for "Mohanlal movies"** ‚Üí Get movies named after Mohanlal (but he's not in them!)
- **Want "action films"** ‚Üí Receive comedies with "Action" in the title
- **Search "horror movies"** ‚Üí Get psychological thrillers from the 1990s
- **Type perfectly** ‚Üí We'll add random typos to movie titles anyway
- **Expect accuracy** ‚Üí We'll swap movie details between recommendations
- **Trust our ratings** ‚Üí We'll "allegedly" adjust them randomly

## üé≠ Features That Make You Question Everything

### Core Trolling Mechanisms
- **Fuzzy Matching Gone Wrong**: Uses advanced algorithms to find the *worst* possible matches
- **Deliberate Inaccuracies**: 20% chance of typos, 10% chance of wrong ratings, guaranteed confusion
- **Vintage Bias**: Prioritizes movies from the stone age (1990s) over modern films
- **Genre Confusion**: "Action" movies that are actually comedies, "Horror" films that are family dramas
- **Random Plot Additions**: Every movie has a surprise dance-off in the climax!

### Interactive Features
- üé≤ Random movie generator (for when you want to be surprised)
- üìä Stats tracking (to see how many times we've trolled you)
- üîç External movie search (when our database fails you, which it will)
- ‚å®Ô∏è Interactive keyboards (because buttons are fun)

## The Algorithm of Confusion

1. **Keyword Extraction**: We find what you're looking for
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: We find something *close enough*
3. **Troll Scoring**: We rank movies by how disappointing they'll be
4. **Response Generation**: We add random errors and call it a day
5. **User Confusion**: Mission accomplished!

## Technical Highlights
