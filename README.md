🎬 Malayalam Movie Troll Bot - CloseEnough_movie

A delightfully useless Telegram bot that gives you movie recommendations... just not the ones you asked for!

🏆 Made for Useless Project 2.0 Hackathon by TinkerHub
The Problem: You ask for good movie recommendations, and you get exactly what you asked for.
Our Solution: You ask for good movie recommendations, and we give you... interesting alternatives! :)
What Makes This Bot Useless?

Ask for "Mohanlal movies" → Get movies named after Mohanlal (but he's not in them!)
Want "action films" → Receive comedies with "Action" in the title
Search "horror movies" → Get psychological thrillers from the 1990s
Type perfectly → We'll add random typos to movie titles anyway
Expect accuracy → We'll swap movie details between recommendations
Trust our ratings → We'll "allegedly" adjust them randomly

🎭 Features That Make You Question Everything
Core Trolling Mechanisms

Fuzzy Matching Gone Wrong: Uses advanced algorithms to find the worst possible matches
Deliberate Inaccuracies: 20% chance of typos, 10% chance of wrong ratings, guaranteed confusion
Vintage Bias: Prioritizes movies from the stone age (1990s) over modern films
Genre Confusion: "Action" movies that are actually comedies, "Horror" films that are family dramas
Random Plot Additions: Every movie has a surprise dance-off in the climax!
